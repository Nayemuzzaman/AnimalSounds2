# AnimalSounds2
AnimalSounds2 is an elaboration on https://github.com/guidrymwg/AnimalSounds to add additional images and sounds, and random switching among options. Includes adding picture and sound associated with a small child.

The projects in these repositories correspond to individual lessons in the free online android programming course at http://eagle.phys.utk.edu/guidry/android/
